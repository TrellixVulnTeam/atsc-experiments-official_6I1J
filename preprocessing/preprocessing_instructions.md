# Preprocessing Instructions

Due to restrictions for some of the official datasets, we are not allowed to upload our preprocessed datasets here. Thus, we provide our preprocessing notebooks and download instructions for the datasets here. Each dataset has its own preprocessing notebook.

## SemEval-14 datasets
Downloading requires an account at metashare which can be set up easily. The dataset-specific links are the following:
